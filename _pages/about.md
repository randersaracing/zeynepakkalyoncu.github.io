:violin: I have played the violin for over 10 years - both solo and as part of the [first amateur symphony orchestra of Turkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h1-MX8i6uA).

♟️ I played for the Turkish National Junior Chess Team for two years, and one of Turkey's best teams for over five years. Although I no longer play chess professionally, I still enjoy a good game every now and then.

:earth_americas: I am an avid traveler, fascinated by what the world has to offer. Below is a map of the few places that I've explored so far. I'm hoping to see more of Canada over the next few years!
